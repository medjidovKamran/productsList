Hello!

####Go through these steps before launching the app.

1. Install all dependencies in the client and server folders.
2. Go to the server folder and run the command in the terminal:
***sequelize db: migrate***
3. Now you can launch the application. Go to parent folder and run the script: ***npm run start*** or run startup scripts for each individual folder (you can find them in the corresponding package.json.
